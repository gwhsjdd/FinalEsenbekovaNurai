Difference between switch and checkout
git checkout: Used for switching branches and restoring files. Versatile but can be confusing.
git switch: Specifically for switching branches, introduced for clarity.
2. What does git merge do?
git merge: Combines changes from one branch into another, creating a merge commit if branches have diverged. Conflicts must be resolved manually if they exist.
3. What happens to the commit history after rebase?
Rebase: Moves a branch to a new base, rewriting commit history to create new commits. Results in a linear history, but alters commit hashes, so use cautiously on shared branches.
4. How to identify local vs. remote branches?
Local branches: List with git branch.
Remote branches: List with git branch -r.
Both: List with git branch -a. Remote branches typically start with origin/.
